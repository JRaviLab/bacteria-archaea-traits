- main dataset is in Table 1 attached, plus explanation and metadata in the pdf
- out of this we only want the rows labelled "cyano" (col C)
- the maximum growth rates are called mu_amm (col M), mu_nit (col W) and mu_p (col AG)
- some rows don't have any of these three, most have only one (in which case we take that one), a few have more than one (in which case we take the highest)
- for some species (col A) there are multiple rows corresponding to different growth conditions such as temperatures -- we take the most favourable (fastest growth) row
- citations for these experiments are given as numbers in col AP, and the actual papers corresponding to the numbers are given in Table 2
- the growth rates mu are specific growth rate per day, so doubling time in hours would be 24*(0.693/mu)

- Note that *Rhabdoderma lineare* cannot be found in the NCBI taxonomy database.
