This data was obtained directly from The.Microbe.Directory at:
https://microbe.directory/

Prcedure: 

1) Scroll to the bottom of the front page and click "Developers"
2) At the top of the developers page there is a link to download the latest database. This currently downloads as an SQL file (this is different from when the data was originally extracted for this project, and therefore we do not include a conversion script from SQL to csv).
3) Click the link to the projects github page for information and code on how to conver the SQL file to .csv using python.
