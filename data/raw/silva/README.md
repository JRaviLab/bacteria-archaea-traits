# Silva_DN

The data_silva_DN070917.csv dataset is based on an original dataset by Vieira-Silva et al. 2010 (see below) and manually curated by Dr Daniel Nielsen to fix erroneous references (not poiting to original source) and data points. 

In some cases, references in the original table is not to primary litterature and in other cases faster growth rates were found for individual organisms.

The Silva_DN_data-file contains both the original data and references from Vieira-Silva et al. 2010 as well as the curated data (DN_* columns) and references. Where no reference is listed in the DN_REFS column, the original reference from Vieira-Silva et al. 2010 should be used.

The clean up process therefore combines the two reference tables to create one reference column for the curated data.
