This data was manually extracted from multiple tables in the original paper:

Energetics of overall metabolic reactions of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic Archaea and Bacteria
Jan P. Amend, Everett L. Shock
FEMS Microbiology reviews 25 (2001) 175-243.

Specifically, files relates to tables as follows:

amend&shock2001_reactions.csv: Combined table of all reactions described in original publication such as Table 6.2
Each reaction was translated into a reaction term by assessing what compounds were oxidised and reduced in each reaction

amend&shock2001_species.csv: Table 2. 

amend&shock2001_species_reactions.csv: Combined table of all tables in original publication such as Table 5.4 where specific species are listed against reactions they are known to carry out. 

amend&shock2001_references.csv: Complete reference list of original publication.

amend&shock2001_namefix.csv: This is a manually created table in which species only included in tables in short name form (i.e. "M. denitrificans" -> "Micrococcus denitrificans") and that could not be translated to full names via information from the original publication - are matched against their full name identified via litterature search.
